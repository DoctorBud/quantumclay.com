## Smartdown

Smartdown is a *declarative*, *literate* and *reactive* authoring technology for writing technical and non-technical documents that are compelling and easy to share and publish within many existing forums and blogging systems. Smartdown is designed for blogging, technical communication, and teaching. Smartdown simplifies the creation of *Explorable Explanations*, which are prose documents with embedded interactive content such as charts, graphs, and featherweight programs called *playables*.


Smartdown enables more people to create compelling and explorable explanations share their ideas and understanding. We hope this helps support sharing between the folks involved in the processes of research, authorship, and publication that are common to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) fields.
