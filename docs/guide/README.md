## About Quantum Clay

Quantum Clay LLC is a scientific software consulting organization based in the Pacific Northwest of the USA. We build systems and tools to support the processes of research, authorship, and publication that are common to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) fields and to the educational efforts associated with these fields.

We are committed to exploring the strange and wonderful possibilities afforded by the palette of technologies and ideas available in the collaborative world of scientists, artists, engineers and educators.

At this time, Quantum Clay LLC consists primarily of myself, [Daniel Keith](https://doctorbud.com), and a network of scientific, creative and engineering talent that can be deployed to address clients' unique problems.
