## InfoClay

InfoClay enables anyone to create compelling and explorable explanations to support the processes of research, authorship, and publication that are common to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) fields.

InfoClay is a lightweight technology that fully embraces modern web principles of offline-capable, service-aware, single-page web applications. Technical content, media and data may be captured and curated while offline, and then shared or published while online.

InfoClay was the laboratory where [Smartdown](/smartdown/) was conceived. InfoClay's UI is somewhat dated, since I've been prioritizing Smartdown development.

You can explore the InfoClay prototype at [https://knowbench.com](https://knowbench.com).
