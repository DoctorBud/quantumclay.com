InfoClay enables anyone to create compelling and explorable explanations to support the processes of research, authorship, and publication that are common to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) fields.

InfoClay is a lightweight technology that fully embraces modern web principles of offline-capable, service-aware, single-page web applications. Technical content, media and data may be captured and curated while offline, and then shared or published while online.

InfoClay was the laboratory where [Smartdown](/smartdown/) was conceived. InfoClay's UI is somewhat dated, since we've been prioritizing Smartdown development.
